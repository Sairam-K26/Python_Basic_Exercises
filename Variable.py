# There are some strict rules for naming variables, if you
# break any of these rules it will cause an error:
# Variable names can only contain letters, numbers,
# and underscores.
# Variable names can't start with a number.
# Variable names can't contain spaces.
# â€¢ Variable names can't be the same as Python
# This will cause an error
# 1st_variable = 10
# This will cause an error
# my variable = 5
# This will cause an error
# calculate total amount = 0
# This will cause an error
# total-amount = 0

# naming conventions:
# Camel case
myVariable = 10
calculateTotalAmount = 0

# Snake case
my_variable = 5
calculate_total_amount = 0

# Pascal case
MyVariable = 7

# Global scope
# A variable that is declared outside of a function is a global variable. It can be accessed from any function in the program.
# Local scope
# A variable that is declared inside a function is a local variable. It can only be accessed from that function.
